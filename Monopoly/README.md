I worked within a six person team using Unity to make a web-based version of Monopoly. The theme was altered to give more of a computer command prompt look, but the game mechanics remained unchanged.

**Components I contributed to:**  
PlayerScript - Handles all player information and their state swapping.  
GameManagerScript - Controlls the game state and holds large scope variables.  
DieScript - Gets two random values, 1-6, and notes if they're the same value.  
TileButtonScript - Handling displaying of title information when clicked.  
UpgradeScript - Property upgrading.   
PropertyScript - Contorlls all property info and allows suying, selling, and mortgaging of properties.  
Creating and placing boardâ€™s art assets.  
  
Working on this project I learned that proper class and method planning is vital to quickly and efficiently building a project with a team. This is so different code segments can be tackled separately, methods are predefined so data retrieval is understood while building, and to ensure minimal time is spent integrating two components.
