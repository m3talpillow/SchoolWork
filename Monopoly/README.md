I worked within a six person team using Unity to make a web-based version of Monopoly.  
The theme was altered to give more of a computer command prompt look, but the game mechanics remained unchanged.

I worked on:  
Player class and state changing  
Game manager, which controlled the game flow and held large scope variables  
Buying, selling, and mortgaging properties  
Creating and placing boardâ€™s art assets  
  
Working on this project I learned that proper class and method planning is vital to quickly and  
efficiently building a project with a team. This is so different code segments can be tackled separately,   
methods are predefined so data retrieval is understood while building, and to ensure minimal time is spent   
integrating two components.
